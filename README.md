# Region-aware Global Context Modeling for Automatic Nerve Segmentation from Ultrasound Images

This is the official repo for the paper [Region-aware Global Context Modeling for Automatic Nerve Segmentation from Ultrasound Images](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16397), published in AAAI2021.

Due to commercial cooperation considerations, we only provide codes of core modules and the whole trainable models for the convenience of comparisons.

Hopefully, We will release all of the codes in the future.

## Requirements
